Armagh and Galway meet on Sunday afternoon in the All-Ireland Football final.

Armagh and Galway meet on Sunday in this year's All-Ireland Football final as the GAA intercounty season draws to a close.

In one of the most wide Open Championships in recent years, fans are expecting a thriller of a final as Galway and Armagh look to end their All-Ireland drought.
The two sides have been knocking on the door in recent years with Galway reaching the 2022 final. But Armagh seemed to have timed their run perfectly after they impressed against Kerry in their semi-final win.

Galway, to their credit, have also impressed as the knocked out All-Ireland winner Dublin and a red-hot Donegal team managed by Jim McGuinness.

All-Ireland finals, by their nature, tend to be close affairs and you’d have to go back to 2007, when Kerry beat Cork by 10 points, for the last time that there were more than two scores between the finalists.

Even the Dublin team of the last decade and more never wiped the floor with anyone in an All-Ireland final when in their pomp.

A replay has been required in two of the last eight seasons and in the last two finals the sides were level in the closing minutes. So, looking at Armagh and Galway’s recent history, whereby only one point has separated them across three Championship meetings since 2022, the potential is certainly there for this game to go one further than the hurling decider last Sunday in the shape of a replay in two weeks’ time.

Digging deeper into those three meetings, Galway had the better of it in at least two of them but were reeled in by Armagh for a pair of draws, one of which resulted in a penalty shootout defeat for Kieran McGeeney’s side, while they finished strongly to win the other.

It sums Armagh up in many ways. They have proven to be stubborn opposition, losing just one of their last 19 Championship games, outside of shootouts. A run like that is no fluke and is a credit to Kieran McGeeney’s management, particularly given that his squad isn’t exactly teeming with top drawer talent.

Doubts around Galway are largely centred on the fitness of their key men, but they’ve carried those issues into games all year and have continually found a way.

All told, Galway have the greater star quality - and the experience to make it count.
